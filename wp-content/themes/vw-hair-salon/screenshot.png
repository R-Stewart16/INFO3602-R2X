<h1>Error reconnecting to the database</h1>
<p>This means that we lost contact with the database server at <code>sql311.byetcluster.com</code>. This could mean your host&#8217;s database server is down.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you sure the database server is running?</li>
<li>Are you sure the database server is not under particularly heavy load?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re unsure what these terms mean you should probably contact your host. If you still need help you can always visit the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forums/">WordPress Support Forums</a>.</p>
